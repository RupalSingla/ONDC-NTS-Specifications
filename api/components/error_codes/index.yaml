      Eg for a Buyer NP can decide to drop a store due to fulfilment rate being < 20% (declared as a
      part of their sorting and filtering criterion). In this case, the response has to be with a
      standard error code : ‘90001’ (illustrative only) along with a message “Fulfillment rate below
      20%” for the said provider ID. Here, the error code 90001 will denote that the Buyer App is
      rejecting at provider level (90), due to a business reason (0) and because the store’s
      fulfilment rate is below 20% (01)
